# Intro

Realization of the process up until now works a bit different than for other permacultural projects. The process steps Observe, Analyze and Design have been the organizatorial and theoretical set-up of the workflow. It is kind of a thesis that has to be proven. To create resilient projects, it is inevitably necessary to evalute them repeatedly to find and fix problems and potential downfalls that could not have been discovered beforehand because the practical experience was missing.

Consequently, this workflow's realization process will be both:
a) an actual "first run" of the workflow that I concepted, meaning testing interview sheets, the Kanban boards and how and if their subsequent structure works. This will help me understand where I thought things too simple or too complex.
b) the realization of a real web development project for a real client. This will serve as the proof of the thesis, leaving me with the first iteration of the evaluation process which can be throughly examined within the next process step.
