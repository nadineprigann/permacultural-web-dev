## Â Research for sustainable web hosters in Germany

Most of the time, there will already be a webspace in use but most likely not a sustainable one. There are some criteria that have to be met in order for the hoster to be classified as sustainable. I found the ones from [Utopia](https://utopia.de/ratgeber/gruenes-webhosting-oekostrom/) to be the most comprehensive collection of these. Based on their list and criteria, my finalists were [BioHost](https://www.biohost.de/) and [GreenSta](https://ssl.greensta.de/). Another good option is [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/de/hosting/web-und-mail/webhosting).

This list will be updated from time to time. If you know another one that might fit, please let me know!

## Initial Call

The first steps were to clarify, which projects are wanted and which idea belongs to which platform and what are our constraints, resources and needs. We identified two separate projects with different goals. For the sake of clarity, I will only outline the project we intend to start with: a website for permaculture designer Nesrin Caglak.

For this interview, I was using my prepared questions on the Trello card. Shortly before the call, I went through them and added some questions particular important to know within the scope of this project. The question arose if these should be sent in advance to make sure the client has enough time to prepare and organize prior to the meeting and then go through them with me to provide clarification and explanations. Idea: create a form and host that here somewhere in the docs. The client can fill out and send them to me so we both have time to prepare.

After the call, I create a shared and password-protected web space within my Nextcloud within my local project folder for the client to upload sketches, material, original content like images and texts to make it easier for me to create a design and, later on, a backend concept.

I realized that there are a lot of questions and that the first call is mostly used to explain the project to me, its history, visions, etc.

I concluded that it makes more sense to schedule a second call to define how this site should feel and work, especiall after the client had some time to let the firast xall sink in. We scheduled a week later. Then, we will go through the more emotional and design-specific topics in a second round as well as content structures.
