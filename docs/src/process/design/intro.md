# Intro

To fulfill this goal, an accessibly tracked workflow could do just that:

- it tracks the current state we're in -> also the workflow which helps in terms of project management
- it visualizes in a simple manner which tasks are up next
- members of the workflow can be notified when they should act
- due dates are visible to everyone
- a central place for notes and how to go about a task
-> everyone is on the same page
